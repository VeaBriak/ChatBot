    "Is it possible to study and work at the same time?": "Russia offers great opportunities for getting a high-quality fundamental education. An MIPT degree enables you to find a well-paid job and start climbing the career ladder right after completing the university program. Students at Russian universities are required to attend all lectures as only the knowledge gained during classroom instruction enables one to become a skilled and knowledgeable professional. This means that side job opportunities are limited to working after classes, on weekends, or during vacations. However, even that should probably be reserved for when you have gotten to know the country and the language better. Usually, it is during the junior year that getting a job really becomes an option, but only if you study well and attend all mandatory classes.",
